                <h3>The user base of the future</h3>
                <p>The disabled population is growing. Modern medicine is allowing people to live longer. According to the 2023 American Community Survey just under 18% of the population, or just over 59 million people, are currently over the age of 65 and the Congressional Budget Office predicts this will grow to 20%, or about 72 million people, by 2031, as the percentage of the population in this age range continues to grow each year. Additionally, more people are living as a result of things they would not have survived in the past. Premature babies, stroke victims, and those who have been in an accident are all more likely to survive the situation, but, in turn, are frequently left with some form of disability.</p>
                <p>As the number of users with disabilities is growing, so is the number of mobile device users. As of 2024, there are 308.65 million individuals in the United States with mobile devices that can access the internet. This is expected to increase to 324.25 million in 2029, a growth of 15.6 million users. A similar trend is occurring across the globe. Implemening Universal Design practices will ensure your website is usable for both of these increasing user bases.</p>

                <h3>It benefits you</h3>
                <p>Designing for as many people as possible means a larger user base which means more possibilities for profit. Additionally, it will be easier to find by all those users as sites with proper semantic coding not only work better with assistive technology, but also with search engines. When search engines can understand your site, they are more likely to serve it as a result.</p>
                <p>Creating a website that's accessible to all users across all browsers and devices also ensures that those users that find you will have a positive experience on your site. A study found that users will take only 50 milliseconds to evaluate the visual appearance of a site. A positive experience will increase customer retention and perhaps increase advertisement by word of mouth from satisfied customers.</p>
                <p>Finally, websites that implement universal design are cheaper and easier to maintain. Separating out different designs for different users not only increases the amount of server space your website requires, but also means double the updates when anything is added or changed in the future, all of which add up to increasing costs. Designing one website for all users allow any future changes to be one and done.</p>

                <h3>It benefits people</h3>
                <p>When things are designed in a manner accessible to all, it allows people to live more independently. Websites that are accessible through assistive technology allow those with disabilities to study, work, and connect through the same means as those without. As technology becomes more integrated into everyday life it becomes more important to design for everyone to ensure no one gets left behind.</p>

                <p>In addition to those with permanent disabilities, many users will at some point face temporary or situational disabilities. A temporary disability may be when someone has broken their arm and cannot use a mouse while they are in a cast, or when someone is sick causing lower mobility and cognition. A situational disability could be when someone has their hands full and can only operate a device with one hand or a limited range of mobility, or when someone is in a loud environment and does not have the ability to hear any audio from their device. All of these users would benefit from proper Universal Design such as keyboard navigation and captioning.</p>

                <h3>It's the law</h3>
                <p>If your business has received any federal funding, you are required to comply with sections 504 and 508 of the Rehabilitation Act. Section 504 mandates that those with disabilities have equal access to all programs, services, and activities that receive federal subsidy and Section 508 requires that electronic information is available to those with disabilities, meeting WCAG AA standards. This applies to content made for employees as well as content aimed at the public.</p>
                <p>Additionally, if you are a public entity, you must abide by the Americans with Disabilities Act. The ADA prevents discrimination against those with disabilities with Title II applying to public agencies such as schools, courts, police departments, and government entities and Title III covering goods, services, facilities, or accommodations provided by places of public accommodation such as lodging, recreation, transportation, education, and medical care. As of 2013 "private entities of all types providing goods and services to the public through their websites operate as places of public accommodation under Title III of the ADA."</p>
                <p>In 2006, the National Federation of the Blind entered a 2-year lawsuit with Target over their website not meeting ADA requirements. Target wound up paying $6 million in the settelement. To be compliant with the law, you <em>must</em> implement Universal Design.</p>
