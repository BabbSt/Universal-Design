                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>My name is Stephanie Babb, and I am a first year student in the ATLAS Creative Technology and Design master's program.
                I completed my undergraduate degree in computer science with focuses in computer systems and human-computer interaction.
                I grew up in Washington, completed my undergrad in Oregon, and spent the past 3 years working in Idaho.
                I like to say I have collected all of the pacific northwest states. I have a passion for sustainability and
                accessibility and hope to incorporate principles of both into my future work. In my free time I enjoy watching 
                football, baseball, and women's gymnastics; doing nail art; and getting outside on a good walk when I can.</p>
