                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>Universal Design involves designing for the widest number of users from a product's inception. A website implementing Universal Design meets users where they're at and can properly function regardless of how a user might interact with it. This includes assistive technology, like screen readers and voice control, but also user preferences, like using an external mouse vs navigating only via the keyboard, and means a screen will look good whether a user is accessing it on their mobile phone, tablet, or large monitor.</p>

                <h3>The 7 principles</h3>
                <p>In 1996, a group of architects, designers, and engineers defined a set of guiding principles for Universal Design.</p>
                <p>The 7 principles of Universal Design are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Equitable Use - The design should not disadvantage or stigmatize any group of users. The same experience should be provided for all users. Identical, when possible, equivalent when not.</li>
                    <li>Flexibility in Use - The design should accommodate a wide range of preferences and abilities in its methods of use</li>
                    <li>Simple, Intuitive Use - The design should be simple and intuitive to understand regardless of knowledge or skill level.</li>
                    <li>Perceptible Information - The design should communicate information effectively</li>
                    <li>Tolerance for Error - The design should minimize the chance and adverse consequences of errors</li>
                    <li>Low Physical Effort - The design should be comfortable to use and cause minimal fatigue</li>
                    <li>Size and Space for Approach and Use - The design should provide enough space for a user to interact with it regardless of the user's body size or range of mobility</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Norman's design principles</h3>
                <p>Donald Norman created a widely accepted list of basic design practices in his popular book, The Design of Everyday Things. Since good design practices are Universal Design practices, Norman's principles should be considered when implementing Universal Design.</p>
                <p>Norman's design principles are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Affordance - The physical characteristics of an object convey how to interact with it
                        <ul class="nested-list">
                            <li>ex: A door handle that should be pulled is shaped in a way that's easier to grip</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Constraints - The user's actions are contrained to avoid errors</li>
                    <li>Visibility - Only relevant items are visible so the user knows what they have the ability to do</li>
                    <li>Feedback - The user is provided with feedback allowing them to know the results of their actions</li>
                    <li>Mapping - The relationship between two things conveys their interaction
                        <ul class="nested-list">
                            <li>ex: A lighswitch is placed near the light it turns on</li>
                            <li>ex: The spacing between buttons and their labels make it clear what button does what</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Ability is a spectrum</h3>
                <p>Thomas Armstrong once said “there is no standard brain … diversity among brains is just as wonderfully enriching as biodiversity and the diversity among cultures and races.” You can't just design for one “standard” user. Both physical and cognitive abilities exist on a spectrum. In every situation a person falls somewhere between “I can do this with no difficulties” and “I can't do this at all”. Everyone has their own limits; no one can do or know everything. Universal design recognizes this and considers users all along the spectrum, providing as many as possible with an equal and usable experience.</p>

                <h3>Seperate isn't equal</h3>
                <p>In the past, addressing users with varied needs meant tacking something on at the end of an already designed product. This solution often meant providing a completely different experience from that of the existing product design. In the physical world, this may look like adding a ramp at the very end of a building design, and, in the case of websites, this often means alternative, text-only versions of the website. These websites frequently provided less dynamic features for navigating the site and were forgotten about during site maintenance and updates, causing them to get left behind. Additionally, text-only websites are designed only for users that rely on a screen reader and do not account for the needs of users with other vision impairments, such as low vision or dyslexia.</p>
                <p>Exemplified by the Equitable Use principle, Universal Design requires that all users are provided with an identical experience whenever possible; in the case it is not possible, users should be provided with an equivalent experience. All users should have access to the exact same information and functionality regardless of how they interact with the product. As part of Universal Design, this equitable use is considered from the very beginning of the design process and is therefore cohesively integrated into the product by the time it's complete.</p>
